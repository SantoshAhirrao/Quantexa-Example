﻿# Project Example Adhoc Code## PurposeThis project is intended for ad-hoc analysis which needs to be preserved. Typically on a project, this may be kept in a separate repository away from the main code base, as it is not part of the software, and leaves the developers susceptible to having to keep ad-hoc code up to date and compiling which is not desirable.However, on project-example, for the purposes of improving maintainability of code repositories, we have kept this as part of the main repository (for now).
